        My name is Ryan Deken (he/him), also known online as pseudoname. I'm a person 
        who likes to program and make music. I'm currently studying Information 
        Technology as an undergraduate at Missouri State University. I'm an 
        avid user, developer, and community moderator of Online Sequencer (OS), 
        a browser-based DAW with a long history and a devoted userbase. You 
        can usually find me there, but in case you can't, some of my other 
        social medias are linked above.

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Here, you'll get a brief list of each programming language I know, in
        order of how familiar I am with it. If it's not here, I have never coded
        with it. Ever. (Italics means I've seen it and plan to learn it in the
        future.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Javascript</b> (vanilla)</li>
        <li><b>HTML/CSS</b></li>
        <p

          I learned the above 3 languages all at the same time. It seemed
          daunting to me, as I had just gotten bored of Python, but I got the
          hang of them before long. (Obviously so, or you wouldn't be reading
          this.)
        </p>
        <li><b>Java</b></li>
        <p
          class="description"

          I became familiar with Java as a consequence of taking AP Computer
          Science A in high school. I used to hate it, but it really grew on me. 
          The syntax is familiar, and if nothing else, it's more efficient than 
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <li><b>Python 3</b></li>
        <p
          class="description"

          Python was the first coding language I ever made a concerted effort to
          learn; I picked it up back in August of 2021. I learned then that I
          not only loved programming, but also had a natural affinity for it; I
          outpaced my school's entry-level programming class in the span of a
          month and change.
        </p>
        <li><i>PHP</i></li>
        <p

          Did you know? 85 percent of OS is coded in PHP. I'm going to
          learn it eventually to work on the site more effectively, but 
          for now I can make the most of what I know.

        Music
      </h2>
      <p class="description">
        I have a decent amount of experience as a performance musician, and I
        consider myself somewhat knowledgeable in digital music production. I'm
        by no means accredited, but I am experienced.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I have 7 years of experience on trumpet, including 4
        seasons of marching band. I started playing in 6th grade and have been
        under the direction of numerous accredited local directors.
        Additionally, I took private trumpet lessons for a year and a half.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I took piano lessons under a private tutor for 3 years, and
        I've given live performances at least 4 times, although never for a
        judge. I also gained 2 years of experience on synthesizer while
        participating in Fort Zumwalt Combined Percussion, formerly Modulation Z.
        While I participated, we won A-Class World Championships in 2022 and 
        came in 2nd place in 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        My digital music production experience doesn't expand past OS - yet.
        I've made plenty of music there, but recently I've had my eyes on using
        Ardour professionally.
