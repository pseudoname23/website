        Hi, I'm Ryan Deken.
      </h1>
      <p class="description">
        My name is Ryan Deken (he/him), also known online as pseudoname. 
        I'm 18 years old and I'm a fan of programming and making music. 
        I'm currently studying Information Technology as an undergraduate at 
        Missouri State University. I'm an avid user, developer, and community 
        moderator of Online Sequencer (OS), a browser-based DAW with a long 
        history and a devoted userbase. You can often find me there, but 
        in case you can't, other contact routes are linked above.
      </p>

      <h2> Education </h2>

        <p class="description">
          I graduated magna cum laude from Fort Zumwalt South High School in 2023.
          While I was a student there, I participated in several activities, including
          marching band, Fort Zumwalt Combined Percussion (formerly Modulation Z),
          and National Honor Society. Currently, I'm studying Information Technology 
          with a focus on Application Development as an undergraduate at Missouri State University.
        </p>

      <h2> Work Experience </h2>

        <p class="description">
          From May to August 2023, I worked at Marco's Pizza in O'Fallon. I quit on August 18th
          to move to Springfield, and for the time being, I'm choosing to focus on my academic
          career rather than pursue a job. The store's phone number is 636-272-5833.
          My boss's name was Michael Engler, and his phone number is 636-293-7423.
        </p>

      <h2> Skills: General </h2>

        <p class="description">
          I'm literate in Spanish after taking 4 year-long classes on it in high school, and
          I'm knowledgable in Excel, having taken an intensive semester course on it in college.
          I'm certified in most of the programming languages in the list below this section.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          Having worked in food service, I can function well under pressure and with
          a smile on my face. I'm adaptable and I can communicate effectively, whether 
          with customers or with teammates. I pride myself on my problem-solving and
          critical thinking skills, which I use on a regular basis to handle programming 
          problems. I approach academic and professional situations with a willingness to
          learn, and social situations empathetically.
        </p>

      <h2>Skills: Programming</h2>
      
      <p class="description">
        Here is a brief list of each programming language I know, in
        order of how familiar I am with it. If it's not here, I probably haven't 
        used it before. (Italics means I've seen it and plan to learn it in the
        future.)
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li><b>Javascript</b> (vanilla)</li>
        <li><b>HTML/CSS</b></li>
        <p
          class="description"
          style="font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 10px 30px 15px;"
        >
          I learned the above 3 languages all at the same time. It seemed
          daunting to me, as I had just gotten bored of Python, but I got the
          hang of them before long. (Obviously so, or you wouldn't be reading
          this.)
        </p>
        
        <li><b>Java</b></li>
        <p
          class="description"
          style="font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 10px 30px 15px;"
        >
          I became familiar with Java as a consequence of taking AP Computer
          Science A in high school. I used to hate it, but it really grew on me. 
          The syntax is familiar, and if nothing else, it's more efficient than 
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        
        <li><b>Python 3</b></li>
        <p
          class="description"
          style="font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 10px 30px 15px;"
        >
          Python was the first coding language I ever made a concerted effort to
          learn; I picked it up back in August of 2021. I learned then that I
          not only loved programming, but also had a natural affinity for it; I
          outpaced my school's entry-level programming class in the span of a
          month and change.
        </p>

        <li><i>SQL</i></li>
        <p
          class="description"
          style="font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 10px 30px 15px;"
        >
          Every good website needs a database. I have rudimentary experience
          in SQL after setting up and hosting local instances of Online Sequencer
          for development purposes.
        </p>
        
        <li><i>PHP</i></li>
        <p
          class="description"
          style="font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 10px 30px 15px;"
        >
          Did you know? 85 percent of OS is coded in PHP. I'm going to
          learn it eventually to work on the site more effectively, but 
          for now I can make the most of what I know.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h2> Skills: Music </h2>
      <p class="description">
        I have a decent amount of experience as a performance musician, and I
        consider myself somewhat knowledgeable in digital music production. I'm
        by no means accredited, but I am experienced.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I have 7 years of experience on trumpet, including 4
        seasons of marching band. I started playing in 6th grade and have been
        under the direction of numerous accredited local directors.
        Additionally, I took private trumpet lessons for a year and a half.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I took piano lessons under a private tutor for 3 years, and
        I've given live performances at least 4 times, although never for a
        judge. I also gained 2 years of experience on synthesizer while
        participating in Fort Zumwalt Combined Percussion, formerly Modulation Z.
        While I participated, we won A-Class World Championships in 2022 and 
        came in 2nd place in 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        My digital music production experience doesn't expand past OS - yet.
        I've made plenty of music there, but recently I've had my eyes on using
        Ardour professionally.
